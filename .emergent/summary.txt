<analysis>
The previous AI engineer meticulously started by analyzing the problem statement, which was to diagnose and fix a white screen error. The initial phase focused on environment setup, including downloading and extracting the provided code archive. A key discovery was the presence of a nested project structure within , which contained the actual React frontend and FastAPI backend, contrasting with the initially provided  and  directories. The engineer successfully installed  to process the archive. Subsequently, a detailed exploration of the  directory, specifically  and , revealed an API call to . This suggests the white screen issue is likely related to data fetching or rendering, forming the basis for future debugging efforts. The engineer effectively completed the reconnaissance phase to identify the active codebase and initial problem vector.

<product_requirements>
The user's primary requirement is to analyze my code and fix the white screen error. This indicates a critical bug in an existing application that prevents it from rendering content. The application is a full-stack project, likely designed for managing or displaying projects, as inferred from the  component attempting to fetch data from a  endpoint. The current product state is non-functional, exhibiting a white screen, which means the frontend is not rendering as expected. The task requires a deep dive into the codebase, identifying the root cause, and implementing a fix to restore functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
-   **FastAPI:** Python framework for the backend API.
-   **MongoDB:** Database used for data storage.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the frontend components.
-   **Supervisor:** Manages backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 3000) processes.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress Rules:** Routes  prefixed requests to backend.
-   **Environment Variables:** Crucial for managing  and .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase was found within a nested directory structure after extraction.
**High-Level Architecture:**
The primary application code resides in , effectively making it the root of the project. This directory contains both the backend and frontend components.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**
App/api/projectsprojects.jsmock.js
The  file is of particular importance as it directly connects to the backend through an API call to . Any issues with this call, the backend endpoint, or the frontend's handling of the response are likely culprits for the white screen error.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Fix the white screen error by addressing the root cause.
-   Install all necessary Node.js (Yarn) and Python dependencies.
-   Verify and ensure proper functioning of both frontend and backend services via Supervisor.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer's work concluded after a thorough initial analysis of the provided codebase. The immediate task was to analyze my code and fix the white screen error. The engineer successfully downloaded and extracted the user's zip file (). A critical finding was that the actual application code was located within a nested  directory, which contained both the  and  folders, rather than directly in the root  as initially described in the environment setup.

The engineer confirmed the project is a full-stack application using React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, with MongoDB as the database. The  utility was installed to facilitate file extraction. The primary focus shifted to the frontend, specifically inspecting  and . The  file was identified as the main component, which includes  and  hooks, and crucially, makes an API call to . This suggests the white screen error is likely due to a problem with this API interaction (e.g., network error, incorrect endpoint, malformed response) or how the frontend processes the data received (or not received). No actual fixes or environment setups were performed yet, only reconnaissance.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to set up the environment by installing all project dependencies (frontend and backend) and then investigate the  endpoint.
